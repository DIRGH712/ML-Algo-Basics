# 1. Supervised Learning
Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. </br>

In this task i have predicted the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.</br>

# 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data.</br>

In task,From the given â€˜Irisâ€™ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.</br>

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.</br>

In this task i have performed â€˜Exploratory Data Analysisâ€™ on dataset [Global Terrorism](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luTU7xBvI7QAGPbQMxEHcgKUi9d6UeP_/view), assuming I'm a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.</br>

# 4. Decision Tree Algorithm
The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data (training data). In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the recordâ€™s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.</br>

Using the 'Iris' dataset I created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.</br>
